          <h2>Merlion</h2>
          <p>
            Singapore's iconic symbol, the Merlion, is a mythical creature with
            a lion's head and a fish's body. The Merlion Park statue, standing
            tall at 8.6 meters, embodies the nation's history. Its fish body
            symbolizes Singapore's humble beginnings as a fishing village, while
            the lion's head references its original name, "Singapura," meaning
            "Lion City" in Sanskrit. This legendary name came from a prince who
            saw a lion-like creature upon landing here. Look out for other
            Merlion statues as you explore Singapore, a city that continues to
            inspire travelers, artists, and its own people.
